A memory game inspired by the anime One Punch Man.

In this challenge I created a simple memory game using new concepts learned, such as: The use of an algorithm to shuffle the cards, where I used the Fisher-Yates Algorithm and also refactored the code in the game.js file after completing the project using the Singleton Design Pattern.

I've always wanted to use Sass and I took advantage of this project to use it, as it makes it a lot easier to create and manipulate our stylesheets files, keeping everything organized and easy to handle.I especially like assembling the code using a pattern of chaining and also separating files for only later to call them with just one @import

This game has 32 characters and each game match is drawn randomly 12 cards to create it pairs on the game board, making the game more dynamic.
